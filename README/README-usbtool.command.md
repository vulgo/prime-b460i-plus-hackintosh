# usbtool.command

After completing the OpenCore `config.plist` according to [README.md](/README.md) the following procedure will generate a valid `USBPorts.kext`

#### Run usbtool.command

- boot the B460i-PLUS system into macOS
- run `usbtool.command` located in the root directory of this repository
- keep within the 15 port limit by switching off at least 2 ports
- press the button to generate `USBPorts.kext` on the desktop

#### Install USBPorts.kext to the Bootloader Kexts Directory

- mount the EFI system partition
- replace `USBPorts.kext` in `/Volumes/EFI/EFI/OC/Kexts` with the version from the desktop

## Sunrise Point

Note that this B460 board wants AppleUSBXHCIPCI loading with class AppleUSBXHCISPT, otherwise USB will not work. PCI device ID injection in the OC config.plist:

```xml
...
<key>DeviceProperties</key>
<dict>
    <key>Add</key>
    <dict>
        ...
        <!-- 200 series USB controller: add supported device ID -->
        <key>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x14,0x0)</key>
        <dict>
             <key>device-id</key>
             <data>r6IAAA==</data>
         </dict>
        ...
    </dict>
</dict>
...

```
